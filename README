• Researcher Login:
◦ This login is mainly used to SUS Results of the Workshop assigned to the user.
◦ It has a “Edit Question” tab, if the user wishes to customize questions for that particuar
Workshop, then it can be done from here.
◦ The system name of the workshop can be changed under the Settings panel.
◦ We can share the url to the users of the SUS Form from the View Form tab on the left

gets a first time randomly generated password that can be seen on the “Add Researcher”
screen in the Admin Login.
